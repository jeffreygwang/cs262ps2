This design does **not** feature a centralized server, runs over sockets, and is designed to be run across multiple machines if necessary.

We used the same wire protocol core from before, with a byte buffering method.

- Interactive:
- Non-interactive:

We were running simulations and saw this happen

interactive and non-interactive modes.

### Observations

Notes

Graphs
